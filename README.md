Objectives
The primary objectives of this project were:

To identify key factors that contribute to fraudulent credit card transactions.
To develop and evaluate a predictive model using logistic regression.
To visualize data trends and findings using Tableau.
Dataset Information
The dataset used for this project includes transaction data from 1,000 credit card customers interacting with 800 merchants over a two-year period. It contains details such as transaction amounts, customer demographics, time of day, and indicators of fraud.

Methodology and Tools
Data Analysis Tools: SAS OnDemand, Tableau
Machine Learning Model: Logistic Regression
Data Visualization: Tableau
The project was divided into several steps, including data preprocessing, feature selection, model development, and visualization of findings.

Challenges Faced
Some key challenges encountered during the project included:

Handling class imbalance in the dataset between fraudulent and legitimate transactions.
Selecting the most relevant features to avoid overfitting.
Creating clear and meaningful visualizations to illustrate complex relationships in the data.
Results
The final model demonstrated an AUC value of 0.8110, indicating strong predictive performance. Visualizations revealed high-risk periods for fraudulent transactions between 10:00 AM and 12:00 PM.

How to Run the Project
Download the repository: Clone or download the project files from this repository.
Data Analysis: Use the provided SAS scripts for running the analysis on the dataset.
Visualization: Tableau visualizations can be accessed through the .twbx files.
Conclusion
This project successfully applied machine learning techniques to detect credit card fraud. By focusing on transaction-specific variables like amount and time, the findings provide actionable insights for financial institutions to refine their fraud detection strategies.
